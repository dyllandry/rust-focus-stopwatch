Immediate stuff:
    ✔ change "interval" to "session" @done(22-07-10 11:20)
        While explaining this to Vicky, instead of saying "interval", I was saying "session".
        Maybe that means I should change the words I used in the technical implementation.
        But maybe the words used in the technical implementation don't have to match how I describe it.
        It is technically an "interval", but it is also a session.
        Interval: a time between events.
        Session: a period devoted to a particular activity
        Yeah, I think I want to use words that also have added business meaning. So "session" instead of just "interval".
    ✘ change "focus" to "work" @cancelled(22-07-10 11:33)
        Was going to do this because when describing the idea to Vicky I kept saying I "worked" instead of I "focused".
        But I'd like this to be a "focus stopwatch" not a "work stopwatch".
    ☐ implement basic crossterm
    ☐ implement basic tui-rs

Long-term:
    - Be able to create your own "modes".
        Like have session types for "development", "PR review", "jira", etc.
        Accept string input from user, use as key in sessions_by_type.
        This will require a UI.
            Could do a TUI with tui-rs https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs
                Only handles visuals, needs other for input
                    Works well with crossterm out of the box https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm
