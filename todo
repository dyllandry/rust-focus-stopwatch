While explaining this to Vicky, instead of saying "interval", I was saying "session".
And instead of "focus" I was saying "work", as this tool is to help me *work* for the right time.
Maybe that means I should change the words I used in the technical implementation.
But maybe the words used in the technical implementation don't have to match how I describe it.
It is technically an "interval", but it is also a session.
Interval: a time between events.
Session: a period devoted to a particular activity
Yeah, I think I want to use words that also have added business meaning. So "session" instead of just "interval".
✔ change "interval" to "session" @done(22-07-10 11:20)
☐ change "focus" to "work"

Long-term:
    - Be able to create your own "modes".
        Like have session types for "development", "PR review", "jira", etc.
